OPENGL_SETUP.TXT           

This file tells how to install OPENGL components for  the 
animation executables CLYNDBOT.EXE and 2LINKBOT.exe
and their associated VC++ projects.

********* FOR THE EXE's ***********

The only OPENGL specific files that are required to run the 
two executables are opengl dll's.  
If you are using WIN98 or WinNT 4 or higher, chances are, 
you already have them.  If not, or if you just can't seem to get 
the exe's to work - make sure that that all of the following 
files are in your system folder (usually found in C:\windows\system)

glu32.dll
glut32.dll
opengl32.dll
lematrix.dll	


If any of these files are  missing, copy them from directory UTIL,
 and place them in the system directory.

******* FOR THE VC++ PROJECTS *********

First make sure that all the dll's are in place.
The included Microsoft VC++ 6.0 workspaces are set to 
use libraries and header files in the UTIL directory.
Everything should work as long as you maintained
the same relative path between the UTIL directory 
and the workspace files.
