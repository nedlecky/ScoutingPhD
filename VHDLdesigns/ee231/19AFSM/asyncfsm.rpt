N.C. = No Connect. This pin has no internal connection to the device.
VCC = Dedicated power pin, which MUST be connected to VCC.
GND = Dedicated ground pin or unused dedicated input, which MUST be connected to GND.
RESERVED = Unused I/O pin, which MUST be left unconnected.

^ = Dedicated configuration pin.
+ = Reserved configuration pin, which is tri-stated during user mode.
* = Reserved configuration pin, which drives out in user mode.
PDn = Power Down pin. 
@ = Special-purpose pin. 
# = JTAG Boundary-Scan Testing/In-System Programming or Configuration Pin. The JTAG inputs TMS and TDI should be tied to VCC and TCK should be tied to GND when not in use.
& = JTAG pin used for I/O. When used as user I/O, JTAG pins must be kept stable before and during configuration.  JTAG pin stability prevents accidental loading of JTAG instructions.
